# tenders_classification_with_LSTM_RNN  
In [this](https://github.com/m4andreyushkova/tenders_classification_with_LSTM_RNN/blob/main/tenders_classification_with_LSTM_RNN.ipynb) notebook I implemented LSTM RNN for multiclass text classification. The dataset contains text descriptions of tenders and their classes. All tenders are divided into 146 classes. **The model's accuracy is about 76.4%**.  

Automatic classification of tenders may be useful for B2B procurement marketplaces. For example, if the cost of model error is twice as high as the cost of manual markup of texts, then the implementation of a model with the above accuracy will cut company expenses by 52.8 %
